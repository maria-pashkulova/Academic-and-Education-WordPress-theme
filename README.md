# About Academic and Education WordPress theme
I integrated HTML template into WordPress to achieve dynamic functionality. This Education WordPress theme allows users to add information about courses, upcoming events, achievements, student reviews and it is integrated with a contact form. You can find the theme itself in wp-content/themes/academy. 
All WordPress installation files and database (img-it-academy.sql) are available to show the results that can be achieved using this custom theme.
